Here's a basic template that you can use and fill in with information about your project:

```markdown
# Library Data Analysis & Visualization Project

## Description

This is where you describe your project. What does it do? Why is it useful? What problem does it solve? This section should be a few sentences or a paragraph long.

## Table of Contents 

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributors](#Contributors)
- [Data Analysis and Visualization](#data-analysis-and-visualization)
- [Error Handling](#error-handling)

## Installation

Describe how to install your project. What software does it depend on? Are there any environment variables to set? List the steps someone needs to take to get your project up and running on their own machine.

```bash

This README template covers the basic sections that most projects should include. Depending on your project, you might want to add more sections - for example, if your project has a lot of code, you might want to add a section that describes the project structure or gives a high-level overview of the codebase.
